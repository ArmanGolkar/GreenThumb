“John and his crew were very easy to work with and built us a fantastic new deck and hot tub. We love it! During 
the design & build phase John was open to new design ideas to incorporate into his plan and always took the time to answer 
my many questions. His crew was always polite and cleaned up the site each day before they left. I highly recommend them if you are considering a new deck for your home.”<br><br>
