      <h1>About Green Thumb Landscaping</h1>
      <p>
        Green Thumb Landscaping got its roots in one of the greenest, most
        picturesque landscapes in the world - Ireland. The lush countryside of
        owner and operator John Duane�s homeland is known to have �40 Shades of
        Green.� Today, John employs the most knowledgeable, capable and
        hardworking team. Each member contributes their own individual talents
        and strong suits, but they all have one thing in common - commitment to
        providing customers with quality products and courteous services. From
        regular lawn maintenance and installing sandstone steps to laying simple
        pathways and designing complex custom yards, our diverse team has the
        qualifications to make your vision reality. We take pride in even the
        smallest project, and are meticulous down to the last blade of grass. We
        take a customer-first approach to everything we do.

          Green Thumb Landscaping treats outdoor spaces like indoor spaces.
          Rocks and debris are picked up and removed, entertaining areas and
          driveways are blown free of dust and dead and decaying vegetation is
          pruned away. No clean up required. 
          <p>
          When the work is done, the only
          thing left for you to do is kick up your feet and bask in your
          picture-ready surroundings. And you may not even know we were there.
